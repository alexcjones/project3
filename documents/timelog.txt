Team 6 Time log

Estimation:
2.5 hr group meeting + 28 hr individual work = 30.5 hr total

Estimation Explanation:
Our group did a bit of researching before doing this project. Most of the videos are simple and straight forward. However, take into consideration that handwriting OCR requires machine leaning, we estimated that this project will take quite a bit of research. So we estimated that this project will take around the same amount of time as project 2.
